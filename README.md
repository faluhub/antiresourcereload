## ARR FOR THIS MC VERSION DOESN'T WORK YET!!

# antiresourcereload
Caches datapack- and server resources to make world creation faster.

# Legalisation Status
Illegal

# Description
I found out about a silly thing that minecraft does which is reloading every resource when you create a world.
This mod caches the datapack- and server resources which essentially removes the "Preparing for world creation..." screen in terms of speed.
Now before you're gonna tell me that it doesn't work, it caches the resources from the first world, meaning the first world's creation speed is normal speed, then the worlds after that are faster.
